### App Idea Evaluation
Evaluate app across the following categories using the [App Evaluation Protocol](https://courses.codepath.com/courses/ios_university/pages/group_project/01_app_brainstorming_guide).

- *Mobile*
    - By using augmented reality, users can walk around and preview photos on the walls of their environment. This is an experience that could never be done on a traditional website.
- *Story*
    - Creates a way for artists and photographers to showcase their photos and paintings, while also providing a platform to buy and sell their work with other users.
- *Market*
    - Artists and photographers, big or small, can showcase their work. 
    - Anyone looking to buy a painting or picture can search through our platform and see how products that they are interested in would look in their own space.
- *Habit*: 
    - Artists and photographers will be using this application daily to view other people's work and also to see how much of their own work has been sold.
    - Other users will use this app on an occasional basis when looking for wall decor.
- *Scope*:
    - In it's simplist form, this app is an AR viewer that allows user to see their pictures on a wall.
    - We would like to build upon this and add a social marketplace aspect to it, allowing users to buy and sell paintings on the platform
